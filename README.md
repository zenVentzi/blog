Low-effort, not a showcase of best practices. If you're looking for how I write code, [HQuest](https://github.com/zenVentzi/HQuest) is a slightly better example. Slightly better, not much, because it's a very old project, 4 years old as of 2022. I could definitely do better now if I were to build one today.
